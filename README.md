This project aims to provide data-driven insights using the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover valuable insights that can inform decisions on house purchases or help analyse the factors influencing changes in house prices in Ames, Iowa, USA. The analysis utilized the following tools and languages: Excel, Tableau, and Python. Given that the dataset contains 80 features, a feature selection process was conducted to identify and focus on the most relevant columns, as using all 80 features would be time-consuming and not all features equally impact house prices. Insights include determining the key factors affecting house prices, exploring the relationship between house prices and neighbourhood locations, and identifying trends in house prices over time and the impact of remodeling on the house price. Lastly, a dashboard was created to visualize the most important insights, providing an interactive and comprehensive overview of the findings to support decision-making.
